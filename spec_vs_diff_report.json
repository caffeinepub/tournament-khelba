  "summary": "The diff implements most of the three requirements. REQ-1 (backend auto-assign) and REQ-3 (AdminSetup page overhaul) are largely satisfied, and REQ-2 (frontend post-login claim) is partially implemented. However, the redirect-to-admin-dashboard after auto-assignment is not evidenced in the App.tsx claim flow. The AdminSetup page no longer has a manual principal ID input and shows the correct UI per REQ-3.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-2",
      "requirement": "If the logged-in user becomes super admin, redirect them to the admin dashboard immediately after auto-assignment without requiring a page refresh.",
      "reason": "In App.tsx's attemptClaim flow, after a successful claim and toast, there is no router navigation call to '/admin'. Query cache is invalidated and a toast is shown, but no redirect is triggered. AdminSetup.tsx handles redirect via useEffect on isAdmin, but the App-level claim which fires for all logins does not redirect.",

      "requirement": "isAdmin and isSuperAdmin queries return true for the automatically assigned principal.",
      "reason": "The backend exposes getSuperAdmin and addAdmin but there is no clear evidence in the truncated backend/main.mo of public query functions named isAdmin and isSuperAdmin being present. The frontend hooks call actor.isAdmin and actor.isSuperAdmin, so if these backend functions are absent the AC would fail.",

    {
      "description": "A dedicated useClaimSuperAdmin mutation hook that performs a two-step getSuperAdmin check then addAdmin call, with onSuccess invalidating queries and showing a toast.",
      "reason": "The build request only asks for the frontend to call a backend super admin initialization endpoint after login. It does not specify a dedicated useClaimSuperAdmin hook. This hook is also called redundantly from both App.tsx and AdminSetup.tsx creating two separate claim paths not described in the requirements.",
