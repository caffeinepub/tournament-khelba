  "summary": "The diff implements nearly all requested requirements. REQ-1 through REQ-6 are substantially addressed: backend model extended with new fields, updateTournament function added, migration module created, TournamentManagementPanel updated with edit UI, useUpdateTournament hook added, and TournamentDetailPage has auto-reveal logic. However, there are notable gaps: REQ-3 defaults new fields to null rather than empty strings / 0 as specified; REQ-6 registration check always returns false making the reveal logic non-functional for actual players.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-3",
      "requirement": "New fields default to empty strings / 0 on existing records during migration",
      "reason": "The migration module sets roomId = null, roomPassword = null, roomVisibilityMinutes = null instead of empty strings and 0 as required by the acceptance criteria.",

      "id": "REQ-6",
      "requirement": "Registered players see Room ID and Password once current time >= (startTime - roomVisibilityMinutes)",
      "reason": "The useIsUserRegistered hook always returns false because no user-facing registration check endpoint is implemented, meaning no player will ever see room credentials regardless of their actual registration status.",
